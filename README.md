# Weather Client

This is a sample web application written in React and Redux.

### S3 Hosting

The **`deploy-to-aws-s3.sh`** script builds the web resources and assets then pushes them to an S3 bucket setup for web hosting.

AWS S3 must be [configured](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html) to host the content before running the deploy script.

### Special Thanks

This sample application was made possible thanks to [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider) and his React and Redux course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).
